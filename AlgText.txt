Algorithm is the step by step approach of solving a problem OR writing a code.

...speed, space, 

BIG O NOTATION IS USED TO MEASURE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR CODE

Object is an ordered data structure 
Array is an unordered data structure


Big o notation is the formula we will be using for our Algorithm

Time Complexity and space


anytime there is iteration u can use 0(n)
